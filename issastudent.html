	<h1>Information System Security Association , Student Chapter Georgia State University  </h1>
	<div>

			<p>Being a member of ISSA Student Club @ GSU, I would like to say it is an inclusive organization made up of innovative technology and business professionals, eager to build upon their cybersecurity knowledge and skill sets. This organization serves as a student lead forum for learning, sharing, networking, and fellowship. Further, our organization aims to create a positive impact on the community, as well as the cybersecurity profession. This form will serve as the avenue for individuals or organizations to sign up and volunteer as a guest speaker at one of our monthly cyber forum events. All regularly scheduled cyber forum events will be held on the Buckhead campus of Georgia State University.<br>

			Click Guest Speaker form link below if you want to be a guest speaker. One of our event manager will connect with you soon.
